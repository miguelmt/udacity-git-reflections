Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A: When working with other people on the same codebase, but also for backup
purposes (you know the 3-2-1 rule: 3 backups, 2 different kinds of media,
1 offsite; well, the one in GitHub is the offsite one).


Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Same reason as why I would like to have manual commits: control. The moment
something is in GitHub, it is there for your colleagues to see... and you may
not want that to happen; you might want to wait until you have something
worth showing... or something that works.
