What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git gets everything ready to have that directory to behave as a repository.
If I didn't do it, then there would be nothing to support the file versions
in the repository; there would only be a regular directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It is different because the files there can be different to the files in the
working directory and in the repository.
It makes sense because it makes it possible to pack all the files that make up
a meaningful change together. I can think of other ways/abstractions to do that
but they are all more cumbersome.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
